# Dead-End

*Dead End* is currently a set of software and "protocols" that allow a person
to dead drop encrypted messages to a single individual. This system allows for
decryption, by the owner of the private key, anyware there is connection to the
system.

The "Dead End" Analogy is to symbolize dropping a message into a secretly known
door. This allows for the "Dead Drop" part, a secret location, while also
preventing anyone from intercepting the messages contents.

This has a neish use. This approach allows for high *confidentiality* and
*accessibility*, from the *CIA Triad*. It does not however, allow for
verification of the data, except through extensions within the message. So the
*integrity* is basically non-existent.
