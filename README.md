# Dead-End

*Dead End* is currently a set of software and "protocols" that allow a person
to dead drop encrypted messages to a single individual. This system allows for
decryption, by the owner of the private key, anyware there is connection to the
system.

The "Dead End" Analogy is to symbolize dropping a message into a secretly known
door. This allows for the "Dead Drop" part, a secret location, while also
preventing anyone from intercepting the messages contents.


## Database

Currently the only supported database is [supabase.io](https://supabase.io/).
More databases should become possible.


## Drop Point (Javascript)

The drop point is a HTML, CSS, and Javascript Site, to allow the use of
"static" site hosting, and still interact with the database.
